# Compilation Errors Fixed ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Navbar.js Corruption** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:** File had quadrupled/duplicated content causing:

- `Identifier 'React' has already been declared`
- `Can't resolve './components/Navbar'`

**Solution:**

- Deleted corrupted file
- Created clean Navbar.js with professional design
- White background, primary-600 blue accents
- Responsive mobile menu

### 2. **index.css Blood Color Reference** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**

- `.blood-drop` class referenced non-existent `from-blood-400` and `to-blood-600` colors
- Error: "The `from-blood-400` class does not exist"

**Solution:**

- Removed entire `.blood-drop` class and animation
- Not needed since blood drop animations were removed from redesign
